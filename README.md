A sidebar widget system for Obsidian.

## Installation

- Download the latest version from the Releases page and extract it to the `Vault/.obsidian/plugins/dms-widget-sidebar` folder.
- Enable the plugin in Obsidian.

## Usage

- Add multiple widgets to the sidebar in the plugin settings
- Activate the widget sidebar from the left Ribbon

## Widgets

### Title

There are two types: large title and small title. They will be rendered as h1 and h3 headings respectively.

The widget code will be used as the title content.

### Digital Clock

Displays the current time in `HH:mm` format. This widget does not require any code setting.

### Time Progress

Displays the progress of the year, month, week, and day. This widget does not require any code setting.

### Text

The widget code will be rendered as Markdown.

## Custom Types

Custom type widgets are rendered as code blocks, with your specified type as the code block language. This can be used to add various specially rendered code blocks, such as `dataviewjs`.

This means you can use many third-party plugins to create your own widgets.

Please note that since these widgets are in the sidebar view rather than within notes, third-party plugins cannot access data like the current note.
