# DMS: Widget Sidebar

A sidebar widget system for Obsidian.

## Installation

- Download the latest version from the Releases page and extract it to the `Vault/.obsidian/plugins/dms-widget-sidebar` folder.

## Widgets

## Custom Types

Custom type widgets are rendered as code blocks, with your specified type as the code block language. This can be used to add various specially rendered code blocks, such as `dataviewjs`.

This means you can use many third-party plugins to create your own widgets.

Please note that since these widgets are in the sidebar view rather than within notes, third-party plugins cannot access data like the current note.
